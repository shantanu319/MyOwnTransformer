Initially, this repository was an implementation of GPT2, from scratch, using PyTorch. It was trained on the WikiText dataset and then subsequently abandoned. I spent some time revamping the project, adding new features, and training it on the cosmopedia dataset. I also wrote a tokenizer for the model, using the Byte Pair Encoding algorithm. The main changes I made were to modernize it, add RoPE embeddings, SwiGLU activations, and RMSNorm layers. I also added a chat interface for the model, using clap + rustyline (essentially a rust wrapper around the python inference server).

The model itself lives in model.py and is a pretty standard pre-norm decoder stack: token embeddings, N decoder layers (attention + SwiGLU feed-forward, each wrapped in RMSNorm with residuals), a final RMSNorm, and an output projection whose weights are tied to the embedding table. RoPE is baked into each attention block — I precompute the cos/sin buffers once at construction time and apply them to the per-head q/k tensors. I stuck with a hand-rolled scaled-dot-product attention instead of the fused F.scaled_dot_product_attention so the mask + dropout plumbing stays visible. The default config is roughly 8M trainable params at d_model=256, 6 layers, 4 heads, seqlen=256 — small enough to fit an overnight run on an M3 Air (what I've been testing the pipeline on). Although I need a GPU cluster of some kind to perform a more complete training run and maybe scale up to 100M parameters.

The tokenizer (tokenizer.py) is a minbpe-style byte-level BPE with the GPT-2 pre-tokenization regex bolted on. It's stdlib-only — no tiktoken or sentencepiece — so the merge loop is transparent and hackable. prepare.py streams cosmopedia from HuggingFace, trains BPE on the first N docs (10k by default), then re-tokenizes the train stream into train.bin/val.bin/test.bin in a single pass via a deterministic 1-in-N holdout split. The .bin shards are raw uint16 token arrays separated by <|endoftext|>, which train.py mmaps for zero-copy batch sampling.

Training (train.py) uses a Muon + AdamW hybrid: Muon for the 2D+ weight matrices, AdamW for embeddings, norms, and biases. I originally hand-rolled Muon — muon.py is still in the repo as a reference artifact — but use torch.optim.Muon for the actual pipeline (muon.py was more of a learning exercise). Learning rate is warmup + cosine decay to 10% of peak, gradients are clipped to a max norm, and the forward pass runs under bfloat16 autocast. resolve_device picks CUDA, then MPS, then CPU, so the same script can run on a GPU cluster without any changes. Checkpoints are written every save_every steps with the full model config embedded in the payload, which is what the chat server later reads to rebuild the architecture.

The chat interface is split in two: a long-running Python inference server (chat_server.py) that loads a checkpoint and reads JSON-line prompts from stdin, and a Rust CLI in chat/ (clap + rustyline) that spawns the Python process as a child and pipes a REPL through it. Inference was kept in Python so I don't have to re-implement the transformer in Rust (low-aura move unfortunately). The Rust side just handles the user-facing loop, history, and process lifecycle. Sampling is top-p + temperature (sample.py), with the running token context capped at max_context so long sessions don't blow up the KV window.

to run the pipeline (train, test, and validate):
    ./run.sh                          # defaults: ~8M params, 1 epoch, full cosmopedia stream
    EPOCHS=3 D_MODEL=128 ./run.sh     # override any knob via env
    FORCE_PREPARE=1 ./run.sh          # rebuild BPE + .bin shards

Total Run:
D_MODEL=384 N_LAYERS=5 HEADS=6 \
SEQLEN=512 BATCHSIZE=16 \
EPOCHS=1 WARMUP_STEPS=300 \
./run.sh

Running on a Modal GPU:

modal_app.py packages the same prepare -> train flow onto Modal so I can burn through the cosmopedia stream on a cloud GPU instead of the M3 Air. One-time setup is `pip install modal && modal setup` (opens a browser to link your account). A named Modal Volume (`myowntransformer-data`) holds the tokenizer + .bin shards + checkpoints, so the data prep only runs once and re-training reuses it.

Common invocations:
    modal run modal_app.py                        # prepare (if needed) + train, defaults on an L4
    modal run modal_app.py --d-model 384 --n-layers 5 --heads 6 \
        --seqlen 512 --batchsize 16 --epochs 1 --warmup-steps 300
    modal run modal_app.py --force-prepare        # rebuild BPE + .bin shards on the volume
    modal run modal_app.py::prepare               # just prep, no training
    modal run modal_app.py::train --epochs 2      # just train, reuse existing volume data
    modal run modal_app.py --bpe-train-docs 500 --epochs 1   # cheap smoke run

Pulling artifacts back once a run finishes (replace `40M_run` with whatever `--dir-name` you used; default is `modal_run`):
    modal volume get myowntransformer-data /saved/40M_run ./modal_out/40M_run
    modal volume get myowntransformer-data /saved/40M_run_learning_curves.png ./modal_out/40M_run_learning_curves.png

    # or grab everything under /saved at once:
    modal volume get myowntransformer-data /saved ./modal_out
The checkpoints land at ./modal_out/<dir_name>/ckpt_*.pt and the plot at ./modal_out/<dir_name>_learning_curves.png.

GPU choice lives in modal_app.py (`gpu="L4"` — roughly $0.80/hr, plenty for the default 8M config). Bump it to `"L40S"` or `"A100"` if you scale the model up. Timeout is 8h; drop it if you want tighter cost guardrails.

Put them in the root directory of this project, then run the CLI by running this command in the terminal (also from the root dir):
cargo run --manifest-path chat/Cargo.toml --release -- \
  --checkpoint ckpt_step21500.pt \
  --data-dir data_cache/cosmopedia \
  --no-cuda
